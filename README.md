# Kaggle-HR-EDA
The repository contains my Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) for an HR dataset from Kaggle. The EDA was performed using Python modules such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib etc.
The goal of the EDA was to understand the data and identify any interesting patterns or trends.
The EDA includes the following steps:

=Importing the data
=Cleaning the data
=Exploratory data analysis
=Visualization of the data
=Identification of interesting patterns or trends (factors of employee retention)

The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.
